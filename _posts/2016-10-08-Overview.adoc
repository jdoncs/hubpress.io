= Overview

This blog is where I write about topics in Computer Science. Usually these topics will be drawn from research papers I read. Sometimes they might come from the popular press instead. Most posts will be reviews of research papers, and most of these will be in or close to my main research area (Artificial Intelligence). Sometimes I might wander into other topics, especially evolutionary computation, computational complexity, and privacy enhancing technologies. These are areas where I have a lot of interest, but probably wouldn't be able to write a useful review in a more formal setting. 

Most posts will be informal, and perhaps even irreverent. Unlike with the peer review process, this is a place for light-hearted readings and perhaps for unconstructive criticism. The point of these reviews is to put down my thoughts in a way that is clear and useful to me, not necessarily to anyone else. In fact, I won't be at all surprised if no one ever reads these!
